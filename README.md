This is a simple selenium bot i built to just automate the swiping on matches
easier. currertly it only logs in.
need to run some kind of task handler to swipe left/right, swipe up/down (scroll) and to introduce some randomness into the timing between swipes and looking so as to appear humanish

later on it would be nice to pull the images and text out of a persons profile, and do some machine learning stuff to make decision on who to swipe on, and possibly reply/talk too.


Need to get firefox or chrome driver and identify path in main.py
when it gets more complex ill move to config.
